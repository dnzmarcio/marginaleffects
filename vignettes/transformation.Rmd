The content of this vignette requires `marginaleffects` version 0.5.1 which was not yet available on CRAN at the time of writing. [You can always install the development version from github.](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/#installation)

This vignette explains how to create custom contrasts and slopes, and how to transform predictions, contrasts, and slopes using arbirary functions.

[The Contrasts vignette](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/mfx02_contrasts.html) defined contrasts as:

> The difference between two adjusted predictions.

This vignette shows how to move beyond such simple differences, by estimating "contrasts" that consist of ratios or arbitrary functions of adjusted predictions. It also shows how to back-transform contrasts to change their scales.

Powerful transformations and custom contrasts are made possible by using three arguments which act at different stages of the computation process:

* `transform_pre`
* `transform_post`
* `transform_avg`

Consider the case of a model with a single predictor $x$. To compute average contrasts, we proceed as follows:

1. Compute adjusted predictions for each row of the dataset for the observed values $x$: $\hat{y}_x$
2. Compute adjusted predictions for each row of the dataset for the observed values $x + 1$: $\hat{y}_{x+1}$
3. `transform_pre`: Compute unit-level contrasts by taking the difference between (or some other function of) adjusted predictions: $\hat{y}_{x+1} - \hat{y}_x$
4. `transform_post`: Transform the unit-level contrasts or return them as-is.
5. Compute the average contrast by taking the mean of unit-level contrasts: $1/N \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{y}_{x+1} - \hat{y}_x$
6. `transform_avg`: Transform the average contrast or return them as-is.

The `transform_pre` argument of the `comparisons()` function determines how adjusted predictions are combined to create a contrast. By default, we take a simple difference between predictions with `hi` value of $x$, and predictions with a `lo` value of $x$: `function(hi, lo) hi-lo`.

The `transform_post` argument of the `comparisons()` function applies a custom transformation to the unit-level contrasts.

The `transform_avg` argument is available in the `tidy()` and `summary()` functions. It applies a custom transformation to the average contrast.

The difference between `transform_post` and `transform_avg` is that the former is applied *before* we take the average, and the latter is applied *to the average*. This seems like a subtle distinction, but it can be important practical implications, since a function of the average is rarely the same as the average of a function:

```{r}
set.seed(1024)
x <- rnorm(100)
exp(mean(x))
mean(exp(x))
```

This vignette shows how to modify steps 3, 4, and 6 to compute custom contrasts: Adjusted Risk Ratios (ARR) and Adjusted Risk Differences (ARD).

# Default contrasts: untransformed differences

To estimate the effect of a change of 1 unit, we do:

```{r}
library(marginaleffects)
library(magrittr)

mod <- glm(vs ~ mpg, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

# construct data

mtcars_minus <- mtcars_plus <- mtcars
mtcars_minus$mpg <- mtcars_minus$mpg - 0.5
mtcars_plus$mpg <- mtcars_plus$mpg + 0.5

# adjusted predictions
yhat_minus <- predict(mod, newdata = mtcars_minus, type = "response")
yhat_plus <- predict(mod, newdata = mtcars_plus, type = "response")

# unit-level contrasts
con <- yhat_plus - yhat_minus

# average contrasts
mean(con)
```

We can use the `comparisons()` and `summary()` functions to obtain the same results:

```{r}
con <- comparisons(mod)
summary(con)
```

# Custom contrasts with `transform_pre`: Ratios

Instead of taking simple differences between adjusted predictions, it can sometimes be useful to compute other forms of contrasts. For example, [the `adjrr` function the `Stata` software package](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X1301300304) can compute "adjusted risk ratios", which are ratios of adjusted predictions. To do this in `R`, we use the `transform_pre` argument:

```{r}
comparisons(mod, transform_pre = "ratio") %>% summary()
```

This result is the average adjusted risk ratio, that is, the adjusted predictions when the `mpg` are incremented by 1, divided by the adjusted predictions when `mpg` is at its original value.

The `transform_pre` accepts different values for common types of contrasts: 'difference', 'ratio', 'lnratio', 'ratioavg', 'lnratioavg', 'lnoravg', 'differenceavg'. These strings are shortcuts for functions that accept two vectors of adjusted predictions and returns a single vector of contrasts. For example, these two commands yield identical results:

```{r}
comparisons(mod, transform_pre = "ratio") %>% summary()

comparisons(mod, transform_pre = function(hi, lo) hi / lo) %>% summary()
```

This mechanism is powerful, because it lets users create fully customized contrasts. Here is a non-sensical example:

```{r}
comparisons(mod, transform_pre = function(hi, lo) sqrt(hi) / log(lo + 10)) %>% summary()
```

The same arguments work in the plotting function `plot_cco()` as well, which allows us to plot various custom contrasts. Here is a comparison of Adjusted Risk Ratio and Adjusted Risk Difference in a model of the probability of survival aboard the Titanic:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
titanic <- "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/Titanic.csv"
titanic <- read.csv(titanic)
mod_titanic <- glm(
    Survived ~ Sex * PClass + Age + I(Age^2),
    family = binomial,
    data = dat)

cmp <- comparisons(mod_titanic)
summary(cmp)

p1 <- plot_cco(
    mod_titanic,
    effect = "Age",
    condition = "Age",
    transform_pre = "ratio") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Ratio\nP(Survival | Age + 1) / P(Survival | Age)")

p2 <- plot_cco(
    mod_titanic,
    effect = "Age",
    condition = "Age") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Difference\nP(Survival | Age + 1) - P(Survival | Age)")

p1 + p2
```

# (Back-)Transforming results with `transform_post`: Adjusted Risk Ratios

By default, the standard errors are computed using the delta method on the scale determined by the `type` argument (e.g., "link" or "response"). Some analysts may prefer to proceed differently. For example, in `Stata`, the `adjrr` computes adjusted risk ratios (ARR) in two steps:

1. Compute the natural log of the ratio between the mean of adjusted predictions with $x+1$ and the mean of adjusted predictions with $x$.
2. Exponentiate the estimate and confidence interval bounds.

Step 1 is easy to achieve with the `transform_pre` argument described above. Step 2 can be achieved with the `transform_post` argument:

```{r}
comparisons(
    mod,
    transform_pre = function(hi, lo) log(mean(hi) / mean(lo)),
    transform_post = exp) %>%
    summary()
```

Note that we can use the `lnratioavg` shortcut instead of defining the function ourselves.

The order of operations in previous command was:

1. Compute the custom unit-level contrasts
2. Exponentiate them
3. Take the average using the `summary()` function

There is a very subtle difference between the procedure above and this code:

```{r}
comparisons(
    mod,
    transform_pre = "lnratioavg") %>%
    summary(transform_avg = exp)
```

Since the `exp` function is now passed to the `transform_avg` argument of `summary()` function, the exponentiation is now done only *after* unit-level contrasts have been averaged. This is what `Stata` appears to does under the hood, and the results are slightly different.

All the same arguments apply to the plotting functions of the `marginaleffects` package as well. For example we can plot the Adjusted Risk Ratio in a model with a quadratic term:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

mod2 <- glm(vs ~ mpg + mpg^2, data = mtcars, family = binomial)

plot_cco(
    mod2,
    effect = list("mpg" = 10),
    condition = "mpg",
    transformation_pre = "ratio") +
    ylab("Adjusted Risk Ratio\nP(vs = 1 | mpg + 10) / P(vs = 1 | mpg)")
```

# Back transforming lognormal hurdle models

With hurdle models, we can fit two separate models simultaneously: 

1. A model that predicts if the outcome is zero or not zero
2. If the outcome is not zero, a model that predicts what the value of the outcome is

We can calculate predictions and marginal effects for each of these hurdle model processes, but doing so requires some variable transformation since the stages of these models use different link functions.

The `hurdle_lognormal()` family in `brms` uses logistic regression (with a logit link) for the hurdle part of the model and lognormal regression (where the outcome is logged before getting used in the model) for the non-hurdled part. Let's look at an example of predicting GDP per capita (which is distributed exponentially) using life expectancy. We'll add some artificial zeros so that we can work with a hurdle stage of the model.

```{r run-hurdle-lognormal-fake, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(brms)
library(marginaleffects)
library(gapminder)

# Build some 0s into the GDP column
set.seed(1234)
gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>% 
  # Make a bunch of GDP values 0
  mutate(prob_zero = ifelse(lifeExp < 50, 0.3, 0.02),
         will_be_zero = rbinom(n(), 1, prob = prob_zero),
         gdpPercap0 = ifelse(will_be_zero, 0, gdpPercap)) %>% 
  select(-prob_zero, -will_be_zero)

mod <- brm(
  bf(gdpPercap0 ~ lifeExp,
     hu ~ lifeExp),
  data = gapminder,
  family = hurdle_lognormal(),
  chains = 4, cores = 4, seed = 1234)
```

```{r load-model-real, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(marginaleffects)
set.seed(1234)

source("../inst/tinytest/helpers.R")
mod <- download_model("brms_lognormal_hurdle")
```

We have two different sets of coefficients here for the two different processes. The hurdle part (`hu`) uses a logit link, and the non-hurdle part (`mu`) uses an identity link. However, that's a slight misnomer—a true identity link would show the coefficients on a non-logged dollar value scale. Because we're using a `lognormal` family, GDP per capita is pre-logged, so the "original" identity scale is actually logged dollars.

```{r model-summary-fake, eval=FALSE}
summary(mod)
```

```{r model-summary-truncated, echo=FALSE}
cat(c(capture.output(summary(mod))[1:14], "..."), sep = "\n")
```

We can get predictions for the `hu` part of the model on the link (logit) scale:

```{r}
predictions(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "link",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
```

…or on the response (percentage point) scale:

```{r}
predictions(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "response",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
```

We can also get slopes for the `hu` part of the model on the link (logit) or response (percentage point) scales:

```{r}
marginaleffects(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "link",
                newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))

marginaleffects(mod, dpar = "hu", type = "response",
                newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
```

Working with the `mu` part of the model is trickier. Switching between `type = "link"` and `type = "response"` doesn't change anything, since the outcome is pre-logged:

```{r}
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", type = "link",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", type = "response",
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)))
```

For **predictions**, we need to exponentiate the results to scale them back up to dollar amounts. We can do this by post-processing the results (e.g. with `dplyr::mutate(predicted = exp(predicted))`), or we can use the `transform_post` argument in `predictions()` to pass the results to `exp()` after getting calculated:

```{r}
predictions(mod, dpar = "mu", 
            newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
            transform_post = exp)
```

We can pass `transform_post = exp` to `plot_cap()` too:

```{r plot-hurdle-parts, fig.width=8, fig.asp=0.618}
plot_cap(
  mod,
  dpar = "hu",
  type = "link",
  condition = "lifeExp") +
  labs(y = "hu",
       title = "Hurdle part (hu)",
       subtitle = "Logit-scale predictions") +
plot_cap(
  mod,
  dpar = "hu",
  type = "response",
  condition = "lifeExp") +
  labs(y = "hu",
       subtitle = "Percentage point-scale predictions") +
plot_cap(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  condition = "lifeExp") +
  labs(y = "mu",
       title = "Non-hurdle part (mu)",
       subtitle = "Log-scale predictions") +
plot_cap(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  transform_post = exp,
  condition = "lifeExp") +
  labs(y = "mu",
       subtitle = "Dollar-scale predictions")
```

For **marginal effects**, we need to transform the predictions *before* calculating the instantaneous slopes. We also can't use the `marginaleffects()` function directly—we need to use `comparisons()` and compute the numerical derivative ourselves (i.e. predict `gdpPercap` at `lifeExp` of 40 and 40.001 and calculate the slope between those predictions). We can use the `transform_pre` argument to pass the pair of predicted values to `exp()` before calculating the slopes:

```{r}
# step size of the numerical derivative
eps <- 0.001

comparisons(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  variables = list(lifeExp = eps),
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
  # rescale the elements of the slope
  # (exp(40.001) - exp(40)) / exp(0.001)
  transform_pre = function(hi, lo) ((exp(hi) - exp(lo)) / exp(eps)) / eps
)
```

We can visually confirm that these are the instantaneous slopes at each of these levels of life expectancy:

```{r hurdle-dollar-slopes, fig.width=7, fig.asp=0.618}
predictions_data <- predictions(
  mod,
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(30, 80, 1)),
  dpar = "mu",
  transform_post = exp
)

slopes_data <- comparisons(
  mod,
  dpar = "mu",
  variables = list(lifeExp = eps),
  newdata = datagrid(lifeExp = seq(40, 80, 20)),
  transform_pre = function(hi, lo) ((exp(hi) - exp(lo)) / exp(eps)) / eps
) %>% 
  left_join(predictions_data, by = "lifeExp") %>%
  # Point-slope formula: (y - y1) = m(x - x1)
  mutate(intercept = comparison * (-lifeExp) + predicted)

ggplot(predictions_data, aes(x = lifeExp, y = predicted)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  geom_abline(data = slopes_data, aes(slope = comparison, intercept = intercept), 
              size = 0.5, color = "red") +
  geom_point(data = slopes_data) +
  geom_label(data = slopes_data, aes(label = paste0("Slope: ", round(comparison, 1))),
             nudge_x = -1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_minimal()
```
